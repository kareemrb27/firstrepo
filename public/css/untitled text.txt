------
TargetServers
	- Environment scoped endpoint/port/ssl
Loadbalancing
	extends target servers so that u can load balance and fail over accross multiple target serves.
http health checks. 
	allows apigee proxies to be proactive at determine backend service failures, instead routing request to failed backed servers, it will mark them down, just as typical load balancer checks.

Big Data:
	is a problem related to large data
	which involves
	volume
	velocity and 
	variety
	
	and also some Garther aggress to have
	varacity mean value. 
	
	if there is no business value of the data then there is no need to store and process in them. 
	so there should be some value of the data to store and process.

1st Generation Distributed systems
	- Proprietary
	- Hardware controlled or fail over
	- expensive
2nd Generation Distributed systems
	- open source
	- software controlled.
	- early 2000's other search engines faces the issue with big data where all website needs indexing.
	- Google and Yahoo 
3rd Generation Distributed Systems.
    - Almost all organizations are facing the big data problem
    - functional programming is in raise. (Where functions are sent to the data location and process the data).
    - RAM is cheaper
    - RAM is used same as disk.
    
Types of Data
	- Structured - Schema based like RDBMS, DB2,
	- Semi structured - XML, JSoN
	- Unstructured - text, video, audio
	
	
- bite code generated by Scala executes much faster than java bite code due to various reasons.
